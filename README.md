## What is qbSat?
qbSat is a mock CubeSat made to teach students the basics of electronics, programming and aerospace in a fun and engaging way! It is a data recording device in the standard CubeSat 1U form factor (10x10x10cm) with both an infrared and visible light camera along with gas, light, and humidity sensors. With custom software, the qbSat can record hours of video from a high altitude balloon or drone. It also hasa a built in web interface to see results in real-time (while in Wi-Fi range) and download your recordings.
